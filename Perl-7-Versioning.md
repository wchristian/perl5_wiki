Perl 5 operates mostly on a [semantic versioning system](https://semver.org/) with the exception that development versions will have an odd numbered minor version

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
1. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
1. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
