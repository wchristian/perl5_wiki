# Perl Governance

At the time of writing (2020-09-07), the governance of `perl5.git` is a work in progress.

That work was described in [a post to perl5-porters on September 6th](https://markmail.org/message/qbeuuav4qprwdvk7) and you can read the [archives of gov-begin](https://perl.topicbox.com/groups/gov-begin), where the work is being carried out.

The (old content of this page](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/wiki/Perl-Steering-Committee/862119387aa3be5b3fb4b5a082380c5d41a1abd1) described the temporary formation of a body called the Perl Steering Committee, which has effectively been replaced (temporarily) by the gov-begin project, and will be replaced (permanently) by whatever that project produces.

You may be here looking for minutes of the meetings of that body: [[Past Perl Steering Committee Meeting Minutes]]
