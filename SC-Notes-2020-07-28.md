# Meeting notes

## Technical Meeting objectives / agenda

- A brief report from the governance working group 
    - We are still sorting through how we feel governance should work. This is being handled outside the technical call and details will be forthcoming.
- Working group report on XS for Perl 7 - Devel::PPPort
    - Karl did work on Devel::PPPort. Thanks!
    - Proceeding with the plan as [already specified.](Perl-7,-XS-and-Devel::PPPort#patch-perl-7)
- Defaults Working group report
    - Currently starting over with a more [step by step approach](https://github.com/atoomic/perl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aobjective)
    - Step 1 is almost complete.
- The plan for opening blead:
    - Open blead for normal development (there will not be a further 5.33)
    - Bump blead to 7.1.0 using the code we've developed already to bump the major version (Step 1)
    - We will proceeed with 7.1.x releases with an eventual release of 7.2 in May(ish) 2021
    - Meanwhile in parallel, we will develop the features for 7.0.0 in an independant branch.
        - We will get 7.0 to a RC state
        - We will test it against CPAN and adjust defaults if needed. 
        - Once we release 7.0.0, the changes will be merged to blead.
    - Once 7.0.0 is released, development norms should return though we do plan to discuss changing those down the road.

## Action items

- 7.0.0 development for core will continue.
- Todd is going to work on extracting the commit for blead to bump it to 7.1.0
- Email to perl5-porters that blead is open.
- Move governance meeting to a different day. Bring up with Stuart and get agreement.

# Future agenda 

The next meeting will be 2020-08-4 13:00 GMT 

## Perl 7.0.0 work.

- How to disable things and return to v5 defaults when needed. - Feature downgrading
    * use p5
    * use compat::perl5 (alternative name to "p5")
    * use v5 (magical v5.0.0 bundle in perl 7?)
        * Perhaps we should overload use v with less things not more.
- discuss the v7 feature bundle
    * Assuming a short major life cycle, should there be a 7.2 bundle or just a 7 bundle?
    * how does one do use v8 in perl 7? Many don't like v8.
        * Essentially turns on all feature guards which are planned for 8.
        * Gives people a preview mode for 8 so they can test.
        * Configure option when building perl?
        * Environment variable?
        * use cool::stuff?
- -e / -E discussion
    * Should -E default to v7? v8?
    * Most people think -e default to v5 and much code has built up around this.
    * perl -$letter is in short supply.
    * A reminder: /usr/bin/perl7 doesn't have to be the same thing as /usr/bin/perl5
- refactor plans for perlpolicy
