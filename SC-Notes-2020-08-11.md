# Meeting notes

## -e/-E discussion. How should it work on Perl 7?

### `-e`

We believe that now and in the future, -e should start out with minimal features enabled. The goal of `perl -e` should be to run quick programs and requiring variable declarations among other things would be too confusing.

### `-E`

Should `-E` include strict/warnings? We felt this should not be changed. `perl -Mstrict -E...` if you want strict.


## How to disable things and return to v5 defaults when needed. (Feature downgrading)

- use v5 already will downgrade perl 7 defaults to a basic bundle. 
    - We may need it to turn off features also.
    - The group did preferred features to not be turned off but research will need be done to determine if this is needed.
    - How do we turn off all features if we want to do this?
- discuss the v7 feature bundle
    - Assuming a short major life cycle, should there be a 7.2 bundle or just a 7 bundle?
        - Yes we want that.
    - how does one do use v8 in perl 7? Many don't like v8.
        - `use experimental ':v8';`
        - `use feature ':8.0';`
