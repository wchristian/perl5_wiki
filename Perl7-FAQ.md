## What's Perl 7?

Perl 7 is Perl v5.32 with saner, more modern defaults. It's a transitional major version before we get to breaking changes.

There's a [Perl 7 proposal](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/wiki/The-Proposal-for-Perl-7) in the wiki for the [perl5 repo](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/).

## Why not Perl 32 (or 34)?

There was some thought to dropping the 5 from the version and using what we already think of as the major version. However, that would reinforce the idea that it's just a continuation of the Perl 5 line. And, 32 is a big number. 

We could have done many things, but we had to choose one of them. Perl 7 is what we chose.

## What are the new defaults?

[We're still talking about that here](Defaults-for-v7). We don't know for sure because we don't have Perl 7 yet. These are some of the things already on the list, although there's no guarantee on anything yet:

* enable strict by default
* enable warnings by default
* enable subroutine signatures
* disable [Indirect Object Syntax](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlobj#Indirect-Object-Syntax)

## When will this happen?

We'd like to be done in less than a year. Ideally sooner. 

## How can I help?

Right now we're early in planning. The details as we understand them can be [found here](The-Proposal-for-Perl-7).

## Will Perl 7 run my Perl 5 code?

The current plan is that Perl 7 will require a [Protocol Declaration](Perl-Protocol-Declaration) at the head of each file. We are working on a module that [will convert](Making-CPAN-work-on-Perl-7) CPAN modules during installation or source trees.

If your code can run under Perl 5.32, you should be able to run it under perl 7. Perl 5 has removed features that were deprecated even when v5.0 was released in 1994. If you are using those, you may need to fix that. Trying your code under v5.32 will find those problems for you.

There will be some compatibility modesâ€”[see Sawyer's announcement from July 3](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2020/07/msg257817.html). The `use VERSION` is going to change behavior to specify major version "protocol" instead of minimum versions and feature bundles. This is a required declaration. 

## What happens to Perl 5?

Perl 5 goes into long term maintenance. That can be as long as a decade or more. You'll still get important security and bug fixes, just for a little bit longer than usual.

The current [Perl support policy](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy.html) guarantees support for the previous two maintenance releases. With a new maintenance release every year, this effectively means two years of support for a major release (such as v5.30 and v5.32).

## What will `/usr/bin/perl` be?

Distros control what `/usr/bin/perl` is, not Perl development. We can provide a suggestion or guidance, especially in `Configure`. Even so, we feel this should be a late decision in the process and advice from distros will be sought even before we do this. 

As the user, your decision is likely made for you. If you aren't going to install your own `perl` for your application, you're stuck on whatever the system provides. If you do install your own `perl`, you will get to decide how that happens.

## What happens if Perl 7 doesn't happen?

We are endeavoring to make [the scope of the bump to 7.0.0](The-Proposal-for-Perl-7#what-we-need-to-do-before-perl-7) as small as possible to make sure it does happen. 

If Perl 7 doesn't happen, we get Perl v5.34 and keep doing that.

We already have all of the code, there are simply some details to work out. This is more paper shuffling and administrative work than anything else. The Perl community already has the tools in place to test all of CPAN against any Perl release. Perl 7 is more about process adjustment than new code. Hopefully this will also shake out any issues so make future major version bumps easier to deal with.

We have been planning this for a year. We've been carefully considering how big a bite we can take. It is our goal to have as modest plan as possible in order to ensure success.

## Will feature X be included?

Perl 7 is v5.32 with different defaults. You won't see new features and you won't have any taken away from you if you're running on v5.32. If it's already in Perl, you can have it. If it isn't, probably not.

There are many things that people want, a significant amount of excitement is already happening around features we want to see in 7.2. Once that is out, you will already be able to use it by declaring `use v8` in your code.

## Will Perl 7 have a new object system?

Many people are interested in Ovid's [Cor proposal](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor). It will go into Perl when and if it is ready. Until it is merged to blead, no promises will be made. It is important we not cause the progress of the Perl language to stall waiting on any one thing that may never come.

## Will UTF-8 features be on by default?

Maybe. Let's see how much work that is. We'd all like to have this, but there's death and destruction in the wake of a big switch like that. Perl has all the features it needs to handle that, but we don't know how much of the community is ready for that.

But, this is not simply enabling some features. Changing the default behavior of encodings is likely to break many programs because the program itself needs to be ready for Unicode (there's a primer in an appendix to the latest [Learning Perl](https://www.learningperl.com). Tom Christiansen answered [Why does modern Perl avoid UTF-8 by default?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6163129/2766176).

## What about Perl 6?

Perl 6 started as an ambitious effort to completely rewrite Perl. For various reasons, that didn't replace Perl and went off to live a separate life as the language now known as [Raku](https://www.raku.org). The number 7 was next in line.

## So when's Perl 8 coming out?

One major version at a time! Let's figure out Perl 7 first.

## What about github.com/perl/perl5 is it named wrong now?

Yes it is. Github will let us rename the repo and redirects should work correctly.

## What about perl 5 porters?

We don't have an answer for this yet.

## Is the idea that major numbers will be incremented every so often, like say, the linux kernel? or do you think it will be perl7 for a long time? just asking out of curiosity

Perl 8 will likely come in the next 3-5 years. We hope to have [Cor](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki) in blead by then. No specific plans are in place beyond that.
